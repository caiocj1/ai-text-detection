Professional identity consists of the individual's alignment of roles, responsibilities, values, and ethical standards to be consistent with practices accepted by their specific profession. Sources of professional identification Researchers have found that a desire for quality (rather than profits) is associated with professional identification. Organizations tend to be concerned with efficiency and profitability, whereas professions care mainly about providing the highest-quality service (as defined by the professions), almost regardless of cost or revenue considerations (Freidson, 2001). Administrators are usually seen as promoting profitability at the expense of profession-defined quality (Freidson, 2001). In one notable study, practicing physicians viewed administrators with medical degrees (e.g., the M.D.) as “outsiders” to the medical profession because of what the physicians believed to be the administrators’ undue emphasis on organizational goals (Hoff, 1999: 336). Practicing physicians viewed administrators with MDs more negatively than those without MDs because the former were thought to have “betrayed” the medical profession by assuming administrative roles (Hoff, 1999: 344).\",\n  'label': 1},\n {'id': 2,\n  'text': \"A magistrate has refused a media ban on the trial of a sex offender .

The case began when African-American motorist James Moseley was arrested for driving without a license in Detroit, Michigan. The arresting officer, Sergeant Gerald Mosley, took Moseley to the station house, where he was placed in a cell with three white men. Mosley filed a federal civil rights lawsuit against Sergeant Gerald Mosley and the City of Detroit, alleging that their segregation policy violated his constitutional rights.   The trial court granted summary judgment to the defendants, finding that Michigan's segregation policy did not violate the Constitution. The United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit reversed, finding that Michigan's segregation policy was unconstitutional and ordering that Moseley be released from custody.

Openness involves six facets, or dimensions: active imagination (fantasy), aesthetic sensitivity, attentiveness to inner feelings, preference for variety (adventurousness), intellectual curiosity, and challenging authority (psychological liberalism). A great deal of psychometric research has demonstrated that these facets or qualities are significantly correlated. Thus, openness can be viewed as a global personality trait consisting of a set of specific traits, habits, and tendencies that cluster together. Openness tends to be normally distributed with a small number of individuals scoring extremely high or low on the trait, and most people scoring moderately. People who score low on openness are considered to be closed to experience. They tend to be conventional and traditional in their outlook and behavior. They prefer familiar routines to new experiences, and generally have a narrower range of interests. Openness has moderate positive relationships with creativity, intelligence and knowledge.

It can take many forms, from false claims of charitable donations to falsifying documentation or bilking donors of their money. Charity fraud is a serious problem, costing charity organizations millions of dollars each year. It can also damage the reputation of charities and lead to reduced donations from potential donors. In some cases, charity fraudsters have even stolen donations intended for charitable purposes. There are several ways that charity fraudsters can exploit the trust of their victims. They may make false claims about the amount of money that their organization has raised or the use that it has made of the funds. They may falsify documents to make it appear as if the organization is more effective than it actually is. Or they may simply steal money from donors by pretending to spend it on charitable purposes when in fact they are spending it on themselves. Whatever form it takes, charity fraud is a criminal offense that should be avoided at all costs. If you are suspicious about any activity that your charity is involved in, please do not hesitate to contact your local police department or the charity's own audit department. In many cases, swift action by the authorities will be enough to put a stop to any wrongdoing and protect the charity's reputation and donors' money\",\n  'label': 0},\n {'id': 108,\n  'text': 'The trackers allows owners to check carrier conditions like temperature .

The L-arabinose operon contains three structural genes: araB, araA, araD (collectively known as araBAD), which encode for three metabolic enzymes that are required for the metabolism of L-arabinose. AraB (ribulokinase), AraA (an isomerase), AraD (an epimerase) produced by these genes catalyse conversion of L-arabinose to an intermediate of the pentose phosphate pathway, D-xylulose-5-phosphate. The structural genes of the L-arabinose operon are transcribed from a common promoter into a single transcript, a mRNA. The expression of the L-arabinose operon is controlled as a single unit by the product of regulatory gene araC and the catabolite activator protein (CAP)-cAMP complex. The regulator protein AraC is sensitive to the level of arabinose and plays a dual role as both an activator in the presence of arabinose and a repressor in the absence of arabinose to regulate the expression of araBAD. AraC protein not only controls the expression of araBAD but also auto-regulates its own expression at high AraC levels.\",\n  'label': 1},\n {'id': 153,\n  'text': \"RNZAF Base Ohakea is an operational base of the Royal New Zealand Air Force.

It is sometimes considered synonymous with the mainline Protestant denominations, though it also has adherents in other traditions. Liberal Christianity began to emerge in the late eighteenth century as a reaction against traditional Protestantism. The leaders of this movement believed that the doctrines of predestination and election were antithetical to human freedom and equality, and that the sacraments should be viewed merely as symbols of grace rather than as means of salvation. They also believed that the Bible should be read without comment or interpretation, and that biblical morality should be applied without regard to social customs or economic conditions. Today, liberal Christianity is represented by a variety of religious denominations and groups. It is strongest among Protestant denominations in North America and Europe, but has also adherents among Catholics, Orthodox Christians, and members of other religious traditions.

The film portrays the German Condor Legion which fought in the Spanish Civil War. Because of the Nazi-Soviet Pact, the production was halted after 15 days of film-shooting, on 25 August 1939, to avoid offending the Soviets who had supported the other side in Spain and who were negatively portrayed in the film. Karl Ritter's diary entry that day states that Hermann Göring had called the Ufa studio to tell him to abort the film.

Cleanliness is often achieved through cleaning. Culturally, cleanliness is usually a good quality, as indicated by the aphorism: \"Cleanliness is next to Godliness\", and may be regarded as contributing to other ideals such as health and beauty. In emphasizing an ongoing procedure or set of habits for the purpose of maintenance and prevention, the concept of cleanliness differs from purity, which is a physical, moral, or ritual state of freedom from pollutants. Whereas purity is usually a quality of an individual or substance, cleanliness has a social dimension and direction or implies a system of interactions. \"Cleanliness,\" observed Jacob Burckhardt, \"is indispensable to our modern notion of social perfection.\" A household or workplace may be said to exhibit cleanliness, but not ordinarily purity; cleanliness also would be a characteristic of the people who maintain cleanness or prevent dirtying.',\n  'label': 1},\n {'id': 304,\n  'text': \"Ashley is now starring in Lane Bryant 's I 'm No Angel campaign .

The Fundamentalist–Modernist controversy emerged in the early 20th century as a battle between two schools of thought within Christianity: Fundamentalists, who defended traditional interpretations of the Bible, and Modernists, who argued that the Bible should be read in light of current scientific and historical knowledge. The debate intensified in 1925 when Christian theologian Reinhold Niebuhr published his book The Nature and Destiny of Man, which attacked traditional Protestant doctrines in favor of a synthesis of Christianity and secular philosophy. The Fundamentalist–Modernist controversy reached a critical point in 1948 when the General Assembly of the World Council of Churches met in Amsterdam to discuss the issue. There, Modernists gained a majority and passed a resolution calling for a reconsideration of the Bible's teachings on science, history, and other subjects. This resolution led to a decline in membership in mainline Protestant churches, which were now perceived as being too aligned with Modernism. The Fundamentalist–Modernist controversy has largely subsided since then, but it remains a significant issue within Christianity. Today, there are still some Fundamentalists who defend traditional interpretations of the Bible against Modernists, but the majority of Christians have moved away from the Fundamentalist–Modernist controversy and have adopted a more moderate stance.\",\n  'label': 0},\n {'id': 374,\n  'text': 'Jon Reiter was attempting his first climb to the summit at the time .

His father, Hēmana Te Whareiro of Ngāti Wāhiao, lived mostly at Whakarewarewa. His mother, Kanea II, was of Tūhourangi, and the Ngāti Tūnohopū hapū of Ngāti Whakaue. In 1864 Mita joined other Te Arawa who fought for the government in the wars of the 1860s. He returned to Whakarewarewa in 1874. In 1883 he represented several hapū of Ngāti Wāhiao in the Native Land Court in a case relating to land claimed by Ngāti Whakaue, including Whakarewarewa, and succeeded in claims to the land on the east side of the Puarenga Stream at Whakarewarewa, although other land was won by Ngāti Whakaue. His success in the land court contributed to a recognition of his leadership among the wider Tūhourangi, in addition to within Ngāti Wāhiao. The 1886 eruption of Mount Tarawera killed many Tūhourangi, and survivors took refuge with Mita and his people at Whakarewarewa and Ōhinemutu. Mita continued to act in the Native Land Court, representing Tūhourangi, and in 1887 won recognition of their claims of the 211,000-acre Rotomahana–Parekārangi block. In 1910 he toured Australia, England and the United States with Maggie Papakura's cultural group.

In a PDM signal, specific amplitude values are not encoded into codewords of pulses of different weight as they would be in pulse-code modulation (PCM); rather, the relative density of the pulses corresponds to the analog signal's amplitude. The output of a 1-bit DAC is the same as the PDM encoding of the signal. Pulse-width modulation (PWM) is a special case of PDM where the switching frequency is fixed and all the pulses corresponding to one sample are contiguous in the digital signal. For a 50% voltage with a resolution of 8-bits, a PWM waveform will turn on for 128 clock cycles and then off for the remaining 128 cycles. With PDM and the same clock rate the signal would alternate between on and off every other cycle. The average is 50% for both waveforms, but the PDM signal switches more often. For 100% or 0% level, they are the same.

Gurney won races in the Formula One, Indy Car, NASCAR, Can-Am, and Trans-Am Series. Gurney is the first of three drivers to have won races in Sports Cars (1958), Formula One (1962), NASCAR (1963), and Indy cars (1967), the other two being Mario Andretti and Juan Pablo Montoya. In 1967, after winning the 24 Hours of Le Mans together with A. J. Foyt, Gurney spontaneously sprayed champagne while celebrating on the podium, which thereafter became a custom at many motorsports events. As owner of All American Racers, he was the first to put a simple right-angle extension on the upper trailing edge of the rear wing. This device, called a Gurney flap, increases downforce and, if well designed, imposes only a relatively small increase in aerodynamic drag. At the 1968 German Grand Prix, he became the first driver ever to use a full face helmet in Grand Prix racing.\",\n  'label': 1},\n {'id': 494,\n  'text': \"Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran lost last appeal against execution .

A similar term, mean circulatory filling pressure, (MCFP) is defined as the mean pressure that exists in the combined circulatory system & pulmonary system when there is no blood motion. The value of MSP in animal experimental models is approximately 7\\xa0mm Hg. It is an indicator of how full the circulatory system is (i.e. the volume of blood in the system compared to the capacity of the system), and is influenced by the volume of circulating blood and the smooth muscle tone in the walls of the venous system (which determines the capacity of the system). MSP is measured in two ways experimentally, and as a result has two alternative naming conventions. MSFP is measured after clamping the aortic root and the great veins at point of entry to right atrium. On the other hand, MCFP is measured experimentally by briefly inducing cardiac arrest or naturally during cardiac arrest once the blood redistributes. It may also be estimated in vivo using a series of inspiratory holds when a patient is on a mechanical ventilator. It can be used to demonstrate effects of drugs on the venous tone while the circulating blood volume remains constant, or to measure haemodynamic changes during haemorrhage.',\n  'label': 1},\n {'id': 497,\n  'text': 'Alhadji Waziri Kolo Ibrahim was a Kanuri military general and politician who served as the Prime Minister of Kanem-Bornu from 1963 to 1967 and from 1978 to 1979.

The CRT has a moderate positive correlation with measures of intelligence, such as the Intelligence Quotient test, and it correlates highly with various measures of mental heuristics. Some research argue that the CRT is actually measuring cognitive abilities (colloquially known as intelligence). Later research showed that the CRT is a multifaceted construct: many start their response with the correct answer, while others fail to solve the test even if they reflect on their intuitive first answer.

Ultralight backpacking can be done with a single backpack or as part of a multi-day backpacking trip. It is a popular form of backpacking for those seeking an extreme camping experience, as well as for thru-hikers and long-distance backpackers who seek to minimize their weight and pack size. Ultralight backpacking typically uses smaller tents, sleeping bags, cooking gear, and other essentials. Many ultralight backpacking trips can be completed with the same amount of gear as standard backpacking trips, but using significantly lighter weight items. This allows for greater mobility and flexibility in the wilderness, making it easier to travel over difficult terrain or to skirt around difficult weather conditions. While there are many different techniques and philosophies associated with ultralight backpacking, a few key principles are common to all forms of lightweight backpacking. These include: carrying only what is necessary, minimizing weight while still providing necessary function and comfort, choosing the right gear for the conditions, and being prepared for whatever might come along.

Irrigation games have a long and storied history. The first irrigation game was probably played in India in the 6th century BC. In modern times, the most famous irrigation game is probably chess, which has been played for centuries across the world. Irrigation games are a particularly interesting form of cooperative game because players must work together to achieve common goals. Players must decide which crops to water, when to water them, and how much water to supply. Players also need to make strategic decisions about which crops to water, in order to maximize their crop yield. Irrigation games can be quite challenging. Players must coordinate their actions in order to achieve the best results. If players fail to cooperate, the game can quickly become chaotic and difficult to play.

It originally aired on the Fox network in the United States on May 17, 2009. The episode title is a parody of the 1988 film Coming to America. The storyline is a pick on illegal immigration to the United States, complete with self-appointed vigilantes and building a fence to prevent it. Tying in with the episode\\'s subject of Norwegian-descended settlers, its first US broadcast coincided with the Norwegian Constitution Day. Plot Krusty the Clown is informed that the Krusty Burger is the unhealthiest fast food in the world, so he decides that his namesake restaurant should serve the \"Mother Nature Burger\" which is entirely vegetarian. All of the townsfolks like the new burgers, but soon the entire town has food poisoning, traced to tainted barley caused by a rat that got caught in the grinder which was grown in the neighboring town of Ogdenville. The ensuing boycott destroys the local barley industry and the residents of Ogdenville, who are descended from Norwegian settlers and portrayed as overly stereotypical, are forced to abandon their town (to Norwegian romantic composer Edvard Grieg\\'s mournful \"Aase\\'s Death\", followed by a phrase from the Finlandia Hymn by his Finnish counterpart Jean Sibelius).',\n  'label': 1},\n {'id': 743,\n  'text': 'Ba Van Nguyen piloted a military helicopter on his own to save his family during the fall of Saigon on April 29 , 1975 .

The case involved an Arkansas man, Hudson, who was stopped while driving and had his car searched without a warrant. The police found cocaine and cash in Hudson's car, and charged him with possession with intent to distribute cocaine. He moved to suppress the evidence, but the trial court ruled in favor of the prosecution. The Arkansas Supreme Court affirmed, and Hudson was sentenced to 10 years in prison. Hudson petitioned the United States Supreme Court, arguing that the Fourth Amendment protects individuals from unreasonable search and seizure. The Court agreed to hear his case, and held that the amendment protects individuals from being arbitrarily stopped and searched without a warrant. The Court also ruled that police must have probable cause to search a person's vehicle, and that evidence found during a search must be suppressed if it was obtained illegally.\",\n  'label': 0},\n {'id': 745,\n  'text': \"Transsexual Kellie was formerly boxing promoter Frank Maloney , 61 .

They were principally used to deliver infantrymen and their equipment to hostile shores. The LCI was designed in the late 1930s as a smaller, more specialized version of the larger LCT (Landing Craft Tank). The LCI was initially conceived as a vessel that could ferry tanks and other heavy equipment across rough seas, providing a fast and efficient way to land troops on hostile shores. In addition to tanks, LCI could carry a variety of other vehicles and supplies, making it an important tool in amphibious warfare. During World War II, LCIs were used extensively by the Allies in both landings in Europe and the Pacific. They played an important role in Operation Overlord, the invasion of Normandy in June 1944, and in later campaigns in Europe and the Pacific. LCIs also played a significant role in the Korean War, where they served as landing ships for United Nations forces.

After the 2008 season, he was rated as a top junior college player and signed to play at LSU. However, recruiting violations by LSU made him ineligible for the 2009 season; unable to transfer to another American football program, he went to work at a DirecTV call center in Colorado Springs, Colorado while he considered his next move. Hicks had an offer to play for the Toronto Argonauts of the Canadian Football League, but decided instead to continue his education and college football career with the Regina Rams of the Canada West Universities Athletic Association. After his first season at Regina, he was drafted by the Omaha Nighthawks of the United Football League, but again decided to stay in college. In his second year at Regina, he made 42 tackles and 6 1/2 sacks and was named the CWUAA's top lineman.
